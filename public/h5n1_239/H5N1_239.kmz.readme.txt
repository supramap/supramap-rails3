Instructions for Janies_etal_H5N1_239_03.03.09.kmzThis file contains interactive visualization of the spread of avian influenza (H5N1) among various hosts, time, and geography.Open the file Janies_etal_H5N1_239_03.03.09.kmz with Google Earth TM (available at earth.google.com) or alternative GIS.Upon initially loading the file, you will see branches representing a phylogeny based on nucleotides sequence data for the PB2 gene for 239 isolates of H5N1.In the places window of the Sidebar of Google Earth, under "temporary places", you will see an arrow labeled "239". Click to tilt this arrow downward and you will see two additional selectable radio buttons named "Host" and "pos627," the later of which is selected by default. When the "pos627" radio button is in selected, red tree branch color represents the presence of lysine at amino acid position 627 of the PB2 protein, white branch color indicates glutamic acid at amino acid position 627 of the PB2 protein.When "Host" is selected this will change the coloring of the tree branches to represent different viral hosts.  yellow=aviangreen=environmental samplepurple=feline blue=humanred=mustelidWe do not recommend selecting both coloring schemes simultaneously.When the user clicks on a node of the tree a pop-up window appears.  This window contains an accounting of the mutations that occur between that node and its most recent ancestor as implied by the tree.
