<h2>How to work with aiTreesapril9.kmz</h2>
<p>After downloading and installing the <a href="http://earth.google.com/download-earth.html" target="_blank">latest version of Google Earth</a>, the file .kmz will be associated with the
Google Earth application, and simply double-clicking the file will open it
properly.</p>
<p>When Google Earth loads the aiTrees.kmz file all the data from our file will
be in the 'Places' frame on the left hand side of the screen. A folder
'aiTrees.kml' should be expanded with four sub-folders; 'Lys-627', 'Host
Order', 'node calculation', and 'credits'. By default the 'credits' folder is
selected for display. Clicking the radio button beside either of the other
folders will load its contents.</p>
<p>If you click on the radio button beside "Host Order" two legends will load on
the screen as well as the tree. At the top of the screen will be a timeline
slider bar: by moving it forward in time you will see the geographic
expansion of the phylogenetic tree. Within the "Tree" sub-folder of "Host
Order" you will find each isolate and Hypothetical Taxonomic Unit (HTU) from
our phylogenetic hypothesis. By double clicking on each isolate or HTU icon
you will be presented with a pop-up window of diagnositic mutations for that
clade.</p>
<p>If you click the radio button beside 'Lys-627', two legends will load on the
screen as well as the tree. At the top of the screen will be a time slider,
by moving slider forward in time you will see the geographic expansion of the
phylogenetic tree. Within the 'Tree' sub-folder of 'Lys-627' you will find
each isolate and Hypothetical Taxonomic Unit (HTU) from our phylogenetic
hypothesis.</p>
<p>In any view, by double clicking on an isolate of interest or using the zoom
tool you can focus on certain geographic areas. There are many more functions
so take your time to explore the tree and don't hesitate to <a href='&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#115;&#117;&#112;&#114;&#97;&#109;&#97;&#112;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;' target='_blank'>ask us questions</a>.</p>
